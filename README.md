# Arabic-hate-speech-Detection-full-project
This research aims to develop a robust system for detecting hate speech in Arabic text. We explore various models, including classical machine learning algorithms, advanced deep learning techniques, and Transformer models. The goal is to identify the most effective approach for accurate hate speech detection in Arabic.
